Formula for SAFE: 
  heightAboveBed / lowestTide < heightAboveBed * wallFactor / embedmentDepth

  When adding a quay wall offer options of construction(gabion, sheet-piles), age, retaining height, embedment depth.
  Calculate a min and a max allowable based on inputs above

Status is processed based on min and max against the four tides each day.

Tides component.

Location - pull api from Google Maps
Location of station? based on coordinates from Admiralty

Why do I get extra stuff in AddQuay page???? Routing issue probably.

Plot a sinusoidal graph based on the four tides
